Steps:
Create a Supply Crate: Place a supply crate in the editor (e.g., Box_NATO_Equip_F) at a location where players can access it.

Create a Vehicle Marker: Create a marker named vehicleMarker (or any name you prefer) where players can claim vehicles.

Add the Script: Create a new script file (e.g., supplySystem.sqf) and paste the following code into it:

sqf
Copy code
// supplySystem.sqf

// Define the marker for claiming vehicles and the vehicle list
private["_marker", "_vehiclePos", "_vehicles", "_suppliesNeeded"];
_marker = "vehicleMarker"; // Change this to your marker name
_vehicles = [
    ["B_MRAP_01_F", "Ifrit"], // Format: [classname, displayName]
    ["B_T_Truck_01_transport_F", "Truck"],
    ["B_MBT_01_cannon_F", "Tank"]
];
_suppliesNeeded = 5; // Number of supplies needed to claim a vehicle

// Function to give supplies to the player
addSupplies = {
    params ["_amount"];
    player setVariable ["supplies", player getVariable ["supplies", 0] + _amount];
    hint format ["You received %1 supplies. Total: %2", _amount, player getVariable ["supplies", 0]];
};

// Create a supply crate with the option to gather supplies
createSupplyCrate = {
    private["_supplyCrate"];
    _supplyCrate = createVehicle ["Box_NATO_Equip_F", position player, [], 0, "NONE"];
    _supplyCrate addAction ["Gather Supplies", {
        addSupplies 1; // Adjust this for how many supplies to give
    }];
};

// Get the position of the vehicle marker
_vehiclePos = getMarkerPos _marker;

// Function to show the vehicle claiming menu
showVehicleMenu = {
    private["_menuItems"];
    _menuItems = [];

    // Create menu items for vehicle claiming
    {
        _menuItems pushBack format ["%1 - %2", _x select 1, _x select 0];
    } forEach _vehicles;

    // Show the menu
    _selection = call BIS_fnc_selectMenu _menuItems;

    // Handle vehicle selection
    if (!isNil "_selection") then {
        // Check supplies
        if (player getVariable ["supplies", 0] >= _suppliesNeeded) then {
            _vehicleClass = _vehicles select _selection select 0;
            _newVehicle = createVehicle [_vehicleClass, player position player, [], 0, "NONE"];
            player setVariable ["supplies", player getVariable ["supplies", 0] - _suppliesNeeded]; // Deduct supplies
            hint format ["You have claimed a %1. Supplies remaining: %2", _vehicles select _selection select 1, player getVariable ["supplies", 0]];
        } else {
            hint "Not enough supplies to claim this vehicle.";
        };
    };
};

// Check if the player is near the vehicle marker and open the menu
while {true} do {
    if (player distance _vehiclePos < 5) then {
        if (inputAction "OpenMenu" > 0) then {
            showVehicleMenu;
        };
    };

    // Sleep for a short period to reduce performance impact
    sleep 1;
};

// Create a supply crate at the start of the mission
createSupplyCrate;
Bind the Key for Opening the Menu: Bind a key (e.g., "F2") in your controls to the OpenMenu action to trigger the vehicle claiming menu.

Execute the Script on Server Start: To run the script when the server starts, add the following line to your init.sqf or in a suitable server-side script:

sqf
Copy code
[] execVM "supplySystem.sqf";
Explanation:
Supply Crate: The script creates a supply crate that players can interact with to gather supplies.
Vehicle List: Customize the _vehicles array with the class names and display names of the vehicles you want to include.
Supply Management: The script tracks supplies using a variable (supplies) and checks if the player has enough supplies to claim a vehicle. Adjust the _suppliesNeeded variable to set the supply cost for each vehicle.
Menu Display: Players can approach the vehicle marker and press the bound key to open the menu and claim vehicles if they have enough supplies.
Testing:
Save your files and load the mission in Arma 3 to test the supply system and vehicle claiming functionality.
